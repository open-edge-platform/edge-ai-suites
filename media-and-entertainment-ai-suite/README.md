Leverage the Media & Entertainment AI Suite to develop applications that help enhance user experience, lower production costs, and increase return on investment by improving content resolution. The AI tools within this suite help optimize bandwidth for high-quality video streams with:

- Open-source software with pre-trained AI models and pre-configured containers that are optimized for IntelÂ® hardware to deliver quality experience to users (high-quality video, expanded video catalog offerings)
- Easily integrated into pre-existing workflows, reduced video bit rate (lower transmission and storage costs)
- Enhanced streaming codec compatibility (HEVC, AVC, AV1) and flexible integrations with cloud and edge infrastructure and orchestration platforms for improved content delivery to target users

Some of the key Intel-optimized libraries for such media and entertainment use cases are:
- [Video Super Resolution](https://github.com/OpenVisualCloud/Video-Super-Resolution-Library): The library provides high-performance, highly customizable, and efficient solution for video upscaling and sharpening, leveraging Intel's cutting-edge hardware and software technologies, while offering seamless integration with industry-standard tools and fostering an open-source community. This is provided as an FFmpeg plugin inside a docker container, to simplify testing and deployment efforts.
- [Media Transport Library](https://github.com/OpenVisualCloud/Media-Transport-Library): Software solution designed for high-throughput, low-latency transmission and reception of media data. 

Sample applications for use cases such as , Video Bit-rate Reduction, along with pre-trained models, and pre-configured containers, such as provided in this [iVSR SDK](https://github.com/OpenVisualCloud/iVSR).
