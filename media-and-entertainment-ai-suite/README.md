[The Media and Entertainment AI Suite](https://github.com/OpenVisualCloud/Media-Entertainment-AI-Suite) is a cloud-native suite of docker containers, reference pipelines, libraries and pre-trained models that are designed to enhance video quality, improve user experience and lower costs for video service providers, such as broadcasters, video streamers, and social media service providers. These suites leverage Intel's AI libraries and frameworks, such as the Enterprise AI Framework and OpenVINO™, to deliver high-value media enhancement use cases. 

Key workloads supported include: 

* [Video Super Resolution (VSR)](https://github.com/OpenVisualCloud/Video-Super-Resolution-Library): This library supports real-time or batch up-scaling of content from older pre-HD formats to HD and 4K, including support for 8-bit and 10-bit content.  VSR is available through a range of different up-scaling models, providing a trade-off between video quality and run-time performance.  

* Video Bit Rate Optimization (SVP): Provided in this [iVSR SDK](https://github.com/OpenVisualCloud/iVSR), SVP reduces video bit rate by without compromising video quality, and is compatible with standard CODECs such as AVC, HEVC and AV1.  Helps to reduce costs through lower transmission and storage requirements. 

The libraries included in the suite are supported on both Intel® Xeon™ CPUs and Intel® Data Center GPUs, and can be easily integrated into existing workflows using FFmpeg plugins provided as part of the libraries.  The libraries are also available as part of the [Edge AI Suites](../), the [Intel® Tiber™ Broadcast Suite](https://github.com/OpenVisualCloud/Intel-Tiber-Broadcast-Suite), and the [Open Visual Cloud](https://github.com/OpenVisualCloud) project.
