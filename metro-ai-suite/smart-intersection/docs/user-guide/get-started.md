# Get Started

<!--
**Sample Description**: Provide a brief overview of the application and its purpose.
-->
The Smart Intersection Application is a modular sample application designed to help developers create intelligent intersection monitoring solutions. By leveraging AI and sensor fusion, this sample application demonstrates how to achieve accurate traffic detection, congestion management, and real-time alerting.

<!--
**What You Can Do**: Highlight the developer workflows supported by the guide.
-->
By following this guide, you will learn how to:
- **Set up the sample application**: Use Docker Compose to quickly deploy the application in your environment.
- **Run a predefined pipeline**: Execute a sample pipeline to see real-time traffic monitoring and object detection in action.
- **Modify application parameters**: Customize settings like input sources, tracking parameters, camera properties and regions of interest to adapt the application to your specific requirements.


## Prerequisites
- Verify that your system meets the [Minimum Requirements](./system-requirements.md).
- Install Docker: [Installation Guide](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/). Enable running docker without "sudo": [Post Install](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/)
- Install Git: [Installing Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)

<!--
**Setup and First Use**: Include installation instructions, basic operation, and initial validation.
-->
## Set up and First Use

<!--
**User Story 1**: Setting Up the Application  
- **As a developer**, I want to set up the application in my environment, so that I can start exploring its functionality.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. Step-by-step instructions for downloading and installing the application.

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   - Run:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/open-edge-platform/edge-ai-suites.git
     cd ./edge-ai-suites/metro-ai-suite/smart-intersection
     ```

2. **Setup Credentials and Download Assets**:
    - Use docker to setup the credentials and download assets:
      ```bash
      docker run --rm -ti \
          -v $(pwd)/init.sh:/init.sh \
          -v $(pwd)/chart:/chart \
          -v $(pwd)/src:/src \
          docker.io/library/python:3.12 bash init.sh
      ```

## Select Deployment Option
