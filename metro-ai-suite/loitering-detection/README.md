# Loitering Detection

## Introduction

Loitering Detection leverages advanced AI algorithms to monitor and analyze real-time video feeds, identifying individuals lingering in designated areas. By proactively detecting suspicious behavior, this system helps to address potential security threats effectively.

Loitering Detection is a demo application developed using Rapid RI Framework. Rapid RI is a comprehensive prototyping tool designed to streamline the deployment and management of AI-driven video analytics on edge devices. It integrates various components such as MQTT, Node-RED, and Grafana to provide a robust and flexible solution for real-time video inference pipelines. The tool is built to be user-friendly, allowing customization without the need for extensive coding knowledge. Validate your ideas by developing an end-to-end solution faster.

**Note:** This tool is not intended for production use.
