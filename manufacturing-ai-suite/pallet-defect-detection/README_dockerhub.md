# Pallet Defect Detection Reference Implementation

This Application enables real-time pallet condition monitoring by running inference workflows across multiple AI models. It connects multiple video streams from warehouse cameras to AI-powered pipelines, all operating efficiently on a single industrial PC. This solution enhances logistics efficiency and inventory management by detecting defects before they impact operations.
