# How to Deploy with Helm

-   **Time to Complete:** 30 minutes
-   **Programming Language:**  Python*

## Get Started

Complete this guide to confirm that your setup is working correctly and try out workflows in the sample application.

## Prerequisites for Target System

-  11th Generation Intel® Core™ processor or above
-  8 GB of memory minimum
-  80 GB of storage space minimum
-  Internet access
-  Ubuntu* 22.04 LTS Desktop
-  K8s installation on single or multi node must be done as pre-requisite to continue the following deployment. Note: The kubernetes cluster is set up with `kubeadm`, `kubectl` and `kubelet` packages on single and multi nodes with `v1.30.2`.
  Refer to tutorials such as <https://adamtheautomator.com/installing-kubernetes-on-ubuntu> and many other
  online tutorials to setup kubernetes cluster on the web with host OS as ubuntu 22.04.
- For helm installation, refer to [helm website](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/)

> **Note**  
> If Ubuntu Desktop is not installed on the target system, follow the instructions from Ubuntu to [install Ubuntu desktop](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/install-ubuntu-desktop).

## Download the helm chart

Follow this procedure on the target system to install the package.

1. Download helm chart with the following command

    `helm pull oci://registry-1.docker.io/intel/weld-porosity-sample-application --version 1.0.0`

2. unzip the package using the following command

    `tar xvf weld-porosity-sample-application-1.0.0.tgz`
    
- Get into the helm directory

    `cd weld-porosity-sample-application`


## Configure and update the environment variables

1. Update the below fields in `values.yaml` file in the helm chart

    ``` sh
    HOST_IP: # replace localhost with system IP example: HOST_IP: 10.100.100.100
    POSTGRES_PASSWORD: # example: POSTGRES_PASSWORD: intel1234
    MINIO_ACCESS_KEY: # example: MINIO_ACCESS_KEY: intel1234
    MINIO_SECRET_KEY: # example: MINIO_SECRET_KEY: intel1234
    http_proxy: # example: http_proxy: http://proxy.example.com:891
    https_proxy: # example: http_proxy: http://proxy.example.com:891
    webrtcturnserver:
        username: # example: username: myuser 
        password: # example: password: mypassword
    ```

2. Update HOST_IP_where_MRaaS_is_running in `evam_config.json` file in the helm chart

    ```shell
         "model_registry": {
            "url": "http://<HOST_IP_where_MRaaS_is_running>:32002",
            "request_timeout": 300,
            "saved_models_dir": "./mr_models"
        },
    ```
## Copy the welding model and video for helm deployment to EVAM

You need to copy your own or existing model into EVAM inorder to run this sample application in kubernates enviornment:

1. The weld porosity classification model is placed as below in the repository under `models`. You can also find the input video file source for inference under `videos`.

- resources/
  - models/
    - weld_porosity/
      - weld_porosity_classification/
        - deployment/
          - Classification/
            - model/
              - model.bin
              - model.xml
  - videos/
    - welding.avi

   > **Note**  
   > You can organize the directory structure for models for different use cases.


2. Build EVAM by including your new AI model (weld porosity classification model used here as an example) and video file. Example steps below:
    - Create the below `Dockerfile` at the root of the repository
      ```sh
      FROM intel/edge-video-analytics-microservice:2.4.0
      # Copy the application files
      COPY ./resources/models/weld_porosity /home/pipeline-server/resources/models/weld_porosity
      COPY ./resources/videos/welding.avi /home/pipeline-server/resources/videos/welding.avi
      # Define the command to run the application
      ENTRYPOINT ["./run.sh"]
      ```
    - Build a new EVAM image with the below command from the root of the repository
      ```sh
      docker build -t intel/edge-video-analytics-microservice:2.4.0 .
      ```
    - Please update `imagePullPolicy` as `imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent` in `values.yaml` in order to use the above built image.

3. Since this is a classification model, ensure to use gvaclassify in the pipeline. For example: See the `weld_porosity_classification` pipeline in `evam_config.json` (present in the repository) where gvaclassify is used.

4. The `evam_config.json` is volume mounted into EVAM in `provision-configmap.yaml` as follows:
    ```sh
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: ConfigMap
    metadata:
      namespace: {{ .Values.namespace }}
      name: evam-config-input
    data:
      config.json: |-
    {{ .Files.Get "evam_config.json" | indent 4 }}
    ```

5. Provide the model path and video file path in the REST/curl command for starting an inferencing workload. Example:
    ```sh
    curl http://<HOST_IP>:30107/pipelines/user_defined_pipelines/weld_porosity_classification -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{
        "source": {
            "uri": "file:///home/pipeline-server/resources/videos/welding.avi",
            "type": "uri"
        },
        "destination": {
            "frame": {
                "type": "webrtc",
                "peer-id": "samplestream"
            }
        },
        "parameters": {
            "classification-properties": {
                    "model": "/home/pipeline-server/resources/models/weld_porosity/weld_porosity_classification/deployment/Classification/model/model.xml",
                    "device": "CPU"
            }
        }
    }'
    ```

## Run multiple AI pipelines

Follow this procedure to run the sample application. In a typical deployment, multiple cameras deliver video streams that are connected to AI pipelines to improve the classification and recognition accuracy. The following demonstrates running two AI pipelines and observing telemetry data from Prometheus* UI.

1. Deploy helm chart

    ```sh
    helm install weld-deploy . -n apps  --create-namespace
    ```

2. Verify all the pods and services are running:

    ```sh
    kubectl get pods -n apps
    kubectl get svc -n apps
    ```

3. Start the weld porosity classification pipeline with the following Client URL (cURL) command by replacing the `<peer-str-id>` with a string id eg: `weld`. This pipeline is configured to run in a loop forever. This REST/cURL request will return a pipeline instance ID, which can be used as an identifier to query later the pipeline status or stop the pipeline instance. For example, a6d67224eacc11ec9f360242c0a86003.

    ``` sh
    curl http://<HOST_IP>:30107/pipelines/user_defined_pipelines/weld_porosity_classification_mlops -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{
        "destination": {
            "frame": {
                "type": "webrtc",
                "peer-id": "<peer-str-id>"
            }
        },
        "parameters": {
            "classification-properties": {
                "model": "/home/pipeline-server/resources/models/weld_porosity/weld_porosity_classification/deployment/Classification/model/model.xml",
                "device": "CPU"
            }
        }
    }'
    ```

4. Start another weld porosity classification pipeline with the following Client URL (cURL) command by replacing the `<different-peer-str-id>` with a different string id than the one in above step. eg: `weldstream`. This pipeline is not configured to run in a loop forever. This REST/cURL request will return a pipeline instance ID, which can be used as an identifier to query later the pipeline status or stop the pipeline instance. For example, a6d67224eacc11ec9f360242c0a86003.

    ``` sh
    curl http://<HOST_IP>:30107/pipelines/user_defined_pipelines/weld_porosity_classification -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{
        "source": {
            "uri": "file:///home/pipeline-server/resources/videos/welding.avi",
            "type": "uri"
        },
        "destination": {
            "frame": {
                "type": "webrtc",
                "peer-id": "<different-peer-str-id>"
            }
        },
        "parameters": {
            "classification-properties": {
                "model": "/home/pipeline-server/resources/models/weld_porosity/weld_porosity_classification/deployment/Classification/model/model.xml",
                "device": "CPU"
            }
        }
    }'
    ```
    **Note: Note the instance ID of this pipeline**

5. View the WebRTC streaming on `http://<HOST_IP>:<mediamtx-port>/<peer-str-id>` and `http://<HOST_IP>:<mediamtx-port>/<different-peer-str-id>`. `mediamtx-port` in this case would be 31111 as configured in .env file

   ![Example of a WebRTC streaming using default mediamtx-port 31111](./images/webrtc-streaming.png)

   Figure 1: WebRTC streaming

   You can view the welding video, where each frame is categorized by the percentage of Good_Weld, Porosity, and No_Weld.

6. Stop the 2nd pipeline using the instance ID noted in point #4 above, before proceeding with this documentation.
   ```shell
   curl --location -X DELETE http://<HOST_IP>:30107/pipelines/{instance_id}
   ```

## MLOps Flow: At runtime, download a new model from model registry and restart the pipeline with the new model.

```
Note: We have removed "model-instance-id=inst0" from the weld_porosity_classification_mlops pipeline in evam_config.json to ensure the proper loading of the new AI model in the MLOps flow. However, as a general rule, keeping "model-instance-id=inst0" in a pipeline is recommended for better performance if you are running multiple instances of the same pipeline.
```

1. Get all the registered models in the model registry
    ```shell
    curl -X GET 'http://<HOST_IP>:32002/models'
    ```

2. The following step demonstrates how to create a sample model file from an existing model folder for uploading to the Model Registry. If you already have a model zip file, you can skip this step.
   ```shell
    cd <weld_porosity_sample_application_repo_workdir>/resources/models/weld_porosity/weld_porosity_classification
    zip -r ../weld_porosity_classification.zip .
   ```
   You can utilize the generated `<path>/weld_porosity_classification.zip` as `<model_file_path.zip>` in the next step

3. Upload a model file to Model Registry
   ```shell
   curl -L -X POST "http://<HOST_IP>:32002/models" \
   -H 'Content-Type: multipart/form-data' \
   -F 'name="YOLO_Test_Model"' \
   -F 'precision="fp32"' \
   -F 'version="v1"' \
   -F 'origin="Geti"' \
   -F 'file=@<model_file_path.zip>;type=application/zip' \
   -F 'project_name="weld-porosity-classification"' \
   -F 'architecture="YOLO"' \
   -F 'category="Classification"'
    ```

4. Check instance ID of currently running pipeline and use it in the next command
   ```shell
   curl --location -X GET http://<HOST_IP>:30107/pipelines/status
   ```

5. Download the files for a specific model from the model registry microservice and restart the running pipeline with the new model. Essentially, the running instance gets aborted and a new instance gets started.
   ```shell
   curl 'http://<HOST_IP>:30107/pipelines/user_defined_pipelines/weld_porosity_classification_mlops/<instance_id_of_currently_running_pipeline>/models' \
   --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
   --data '{
        "project_name": "weld-porosity-classification",
        "version": "v1",
        "category": "Classification",
        "architecture": "YOLO",
        "precision": "fp32",
        "deploy": true,
        "pipeline_element_name": "classification",
        "origin": "Geti",
        "name": "YOLO_Test_Model"
   }'
   ```

    Note: The data above assumes there is a model in the registry that contains these properties. Note: The pipeline name that follows user_defined_pipelines, will affect the `deployment` folder name.


6. View the WebRTC streaming on `http://<HOST_IP>:<mediamtx-port>/<peer-str-id>` by replacing `<peer-str-id>` with the value used in the cURL command to start the pipeline.

   ![Example of a WebRTC streaming using default mediamtx-port 31111](./images/webrtc-streaming.png)

   Figure 2: WebRTC streaming

7. You can also stop any running pipeline by using the pipeline instance "id"
   ```shell
   curl --location -X DELETE http://<HOST_IP>:30107/pipelines/{instance_id}
   ```

## EVAM S3 frame storage

Follow this procedure to test the EVAM S3 storage using the helm.

1. Install the pip package boto3 once if not installed with the following command
      > pip3 install boto3==1.36.17
2. Create a S3 bucket using the following script.

   ```python
   import boto3
   url = "http://<HOST_IP>:30800"
   user = "<value of MINIO_ACCESS_KEY used in .env>"
   password = "<value of MINIO_SECRET_KEY used in .env>"
   bucket_name = "ecgdemo"

   client= boto3.client(
               "s3",
               endpoint_url=url,
               aws_access_key_id=user,
               aws_secret_access_key=password
   )
   client.create_bucket(Bucket=bucket_name)
   buckets = client.list_buckets()
   print("Buckets:", [b["Name"] for b in buckets.get("Buckets", [])])
   ```

3. Start the pipeline with the following cURL command. Ensure to give the correct path to the model as seen below. This example starts an AI pipeline.

   ```sh
    curl http://<HOST_IP>:30107/pipelines/user_defined_pipelines/weld_porosity_classification_s3write -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{
        "source": {
            "uri": "file:///home/pipeline-server/resources/videos/welding.avi",
            "type": "uri"
        },
        "destination": {
            "frame": {
                "type": "webrtc",
                "peer-id": "welds3"
            }
        },
        "parameters": {
            "classification-properties": {
                "model": "/home/pipeline-server/resources/models/weld_porosity/weld_porosity_classification/deployment/Classification/model/model.xml",
                "device": "CPU"
            }
        }
    }'
   ```

4. Go to MinIO console on `http://<HOST_IP>:30800/` and login with `MINIO_ACCESS_KEY` and `MINIO_SECRET_KEY` provided in `values.yml` file. After logging into console, you can go to  `ecgdemo` bucket and check the frames stored.

## View Open Telemetry Data

EVAM supports gathering metrics over Open Telemetry. The supported metrics currently are:
- `cpu_usage_percentage`: Tracks CPU usage percentage of EVAM python process
- `memory_usage_bytes`: Tracks memory usage in bytes of EVAM python process
- `fps_per_pipeline`: Tracks FPS for each active pipeline instance in EVAM

- Open `http://<HOST_IP>:30909` in your browser to view the prometheus console and try out the below queries:
    - `cpu_usage_percentage`
    - `memory_usage_bytes`
    - `fps_per_pipeline{}`
        - If you are starting multiple pipelines, then it can also be queried per pipeline ID. Example: `fps_per_pipeline{pipeline_id="658a5260f37d11ef94fc0242ac160005"}`

    ![Open telemetry fps_per_pipeline example in prometheus](./images/prometheus_fps_per_pipeline.png)

## End the demonstration

Follow this procedure to stop the sample application and end this demonstration.

1. Stop the sample application with the following command that uninstalls the release weld-deploy.

    ```sh
    helm uninstall weld-deploy -n apps
    ```
    

2. Confirm the pods are no longer running.

    ```sh
    kubectl get pods -n apps
    ```


## Summary

In this guide, you installed and validated the Weld Porosity Sample Application. You also completed a demonstration where multiple pipelines run on a single system with near real-time classification.


## Troubleshooting

The following are options to help you resolve issues with the sample application.

### Deploying with Intel GPU K8S Extension on ITEP

If you're deploying a GPU based pipeline (example: with VA-API elements like `vapostproc`, `vah264dec` etc., and/or with `device=GPU` in `gvadetect` in `evam_config.json`) with Intel GPU k8s Extension on ITEP, ensure to add the below under `containers` section in the Deployment present in the file `helm/templates/edge-video-analytics-microservice.yaml` in order to utilize the underlying GPU.
```sh
resources:
    limits:
    gpu.intel.com/i915: 1
```

### Error Logs

View the container logs using this command.

         kubectl logs -f <pod_name> -n apps

### Resolving Time Sync Issues in Prometheus

If you see the following warning in Prometheus, it indicates a time sync issue.

**Warning: Error fetching server time: Detected xxx.xxx seconds time difference between your browser and the server.**

You can following the below steps to synchronize system time using NTP.
1. **Install systemd-timesyncd** if not already installed:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install systemd-timesyncd
   ```

2. **Check service status**:
   ```bash
   systemctl status systemd-timesyncd
   ```

3. **Configure an NTP server** (if behind a corporate proxy):
   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/systemd/timesyncd.conf
   ```
   Add:
   ```ini
   [Time]
   NTP=corp.intel.com
   ```
   Replace `corp.intel.com` with a different ntp server that is supported on your network.

4. **Restart the service**:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart systemd-timesyncd
   ```

5. **Verify the status**:
   ```bash
   systemctl status systemd-timesyncd
   ```

This should resolve the time discrepancy in Prometheus.
