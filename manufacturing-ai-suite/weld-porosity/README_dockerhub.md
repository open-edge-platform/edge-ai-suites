# Weld Porosity Sample Application

AI and machine vision enable real-time detection of welding defects, ensuring immediate corrective action before issues escalate. By leveraging the right camera and computing hardware, a trained AI model continuously monitors the weld, halting the process the moment a defect is detected. Deep learning AI processes video data at frame rates far beyond human capability, delivering unmatched precision and reliability.
