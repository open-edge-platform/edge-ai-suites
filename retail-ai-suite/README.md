The Retail AI Suite is an open-source software framework designed to accelerate AI workload evaluation and hardware selection for point-of-sale use cases at the edge. It helps retail solution builders assess device configurations across IntelÂ® product generations to enhance decision-making and reduce the total cost of ownership. Key use cases include:
- [Automated Self-Checkout](https://github.com/intel-retail/automated-self-checkout): Product recognition (detection, classification, and tracking), full pipeline (product, weight, text, and barcode), age verification
- [Loss Prevention](https://github.com/intel-retail/loss-prevention): Fake scans, items in basket, multi-product identification, product switching, shopper behavior (obscuring/hiding an item), event video summation
- Order Accuracy: [**Coming soon**] Order validation (product recognition), packing video summation

Performance evaluation: For computer vision pipeline benchmarking for retail use cases, a detailed guide is provided [here](https://github.com/intel-retail/performance-tools?tab=readme-ov-file).
